## Getting Started 
If you haven't already, go ahead and introduce yourself in the [#introductions](30daypythonchallenge.slack.com) channel. Please share your interests, hobbies, career status/future goals, or whatever! This is a good way to meet others with similar interests. :wink:

Example:

> Hey, y'all! My name is Acat. I'm currently an Analyst, but am preparing for a Data Engineer role within the cleantech industry! Outside of tech, I enjoy baking and singing in the shower. 


If you are new to Slack, then [here's](https://slack.com/help/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-) a quick rundown of how it works. Channels are a good way to keep conversations under the :umbrella: of a specific topic or context. Channels appear on the upper left side bar of the Slack UI.

Channel topics can be specific to the challenge assignments like [#week0:5](h30daypythonchallenge.slack.com) or more general. In the channel [#python-programming](30daypythonchallenge.slack.com), you can discuss anything related to Python (outside of the challenge content). It will be used for general Python questions or discussions. And we have a channel for talking about things other than Python, such as [#random](30daypythonchallenge.slack.com) for general conversation. Please explore and join as many channels as interest you -- and if you have a suggestion for a new channel, feel free to start a discussion about it in our [#general](30daypythonchallenge.slack.com) channel.

### Asking Questions

Remember these are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgement.

If the question relates to a channel topic then it is best to ask the question in that channel. When you have found the channel that best fits the topic of your question ask your question and wait for someone to respond. You do not need to say, `Hello` or `Is anyone in here that can help me?` Simply, ask your question and wait. Additionally, to receive the best help possible it is a good idea to have some code samples handy to post in the chat. The code samples section below will explain more about how to post them.

Asking good questions can be hard, generally it's best to say what you are trying to accomplish along with what you think you may need to do. For a good overview on how to ask good questions take a look at [How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

### Cross posting

Please try to refrain from cross-posting in multiple channels. If you have asked your question in a channel and have waited a while you can move to a more [#random](30daypythonchallenge.slack.com) channel. In order to cross-post, find your chat message and [share the message](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/203274767-Share-messages-in-Slack) in the other channel.

### Code samples

Due to the nature of our wonderful and glorious community you may want to share code with us. Slack is really good for this. If your code sample is only a few lines you can use three backticks (above the `TAB` key on many keyboard layouts) at the beginning of the code sample and after the sample. You may need to hit `SHIFT + ENTER` to create a new line.

If your code sample contains many lines, or is complicated code that can benefit from syntax highlighting, then it is best to [create a Snippet](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204145658-Create-a-snippet). You can do so from the chat box by clicking the :heavy_plus_sign:. Snippets become files and can be commented on by other users.

### Self promotion and shameless plugs

To help prevent spam, and a wall of text in [#random](30daypythonchallenge.slack.com) and other channels, we have [#python-programming](30daypythonchallenge.slack.com) to talk about any programming products, showcase it, ask for advice, or to ask people to try it out. These posts should only be in this channel and hence are not desired in other channels. 

### Slash commands

Slash commands start with a "/" character, and can be used to perform a variety of useful tasks while using Slack in general, and Pyslackers in particular.

To display a list of available slash commands, start a message in a channel with the "/" character (note: the list of displayed commands may differ between desktop and mobile versions of Slack).

Some useful slash commands:

* /admin <message> :: see the "Need an admin?" section below
* /report <message> :: send a report to the admin team about a specific user (please include the user's name)
* /justask :: posts a message explaining that members don't need to ask if they can ask a question
* /howtoask :: posts some helpful content on how to ask good quality question
* /shrug <message> :: a fun command that posts your message, followed by an ascii representation of a person shrugging (¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
