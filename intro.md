# Introduction

While doing homework for a Python class, Takeria and I (Shelby) had the idea to create a platform within the Sista Circle: Black Women in Tech's Facebook Group where members can come together to learn Python through paired programming. This idea morphed into the Learn Python in 30 Days Challenge! :tada:

The challenge will explore the fundamentals of computer programming by using the popular (and beginner-friendly) Python programming language. This challenge is for everyone! It requires no previous background in programming---just a willingness to work hard and a love for learning. It requires some dedication (~7hrs/wk) and hard work, over a course of 4/5 weeks. By the end of the challenge, you will know how to write Python scripts, grab data from a website or API, and work with Flask to host your final analytics/visualization project.  

### Challenge Structure
* **Lecture videos every week:** In lectures, Takeria and I will discuss the relevant skills and techniques necessary to complete the assignments.
* **One 40min section every week:** Section is a weekly meeting to interact with your peers, work through assignments, and debug code.
* **Three assignments:** The assignments are a chance to solidify what you've learned in lecture and section and apply it to real-world scenarios.
* **Final project:** You will combine everything you've learned to produce a final analytics/visualization project.
